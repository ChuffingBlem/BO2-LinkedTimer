# BO2-LinkedTimer
Linked timer for Black Ops 2 Zombies

• Added support for normal BO2 process names (now works on t6zm.exe and t6zmv41.exe)

• Added a delay of 7 seconds to the start of the timer so the time is more accurate for speedrunning

• To use it, right click on the timer, click start at, then click start. Now the timer should automatically start when loading into a map

• Credit to Furret for the original linked timer that I used to make these additions
